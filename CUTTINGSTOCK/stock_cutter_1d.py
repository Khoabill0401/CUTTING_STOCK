    Book Author's note from page 201:
    [the following constraint]  breaks the symmetry of multiple solutions that are equivalent 
    for our purposes: any permutation of the rolls. These permutations, and there are K! of 
    them, cause most solvers to spend an exorbitant time solving. With this constraint, we 
    tell the solver to prefer those permutations with more cuts in roll j than in roll j + 1. 
    The reader is encouraged to solve a medium-sized problem with and without this 
    symmetry-breaking constraint. I have seen problems take 48 hours to solve without the 
    constraint and 48 minutes with. Of course, for problems that are solved in seconds, the 
    constraint will not help; it may even hinder. But who cares if a cutting stock instance 
    solves in two or in three seconds? We care much more about the difference between two 
    minutes and three hours, which is what this constraint is meant to address

    minimize total big rolls used
    let's say we have y = [1, 0, 1]
    here, total big rolls used are 2. 0-th and 2nd. 1st one is not used. So we want our model to use the 
    earlier rolls first. i.e. y = [1, 1, 0]. 
    The trick to do this is to define the cost of using each next roll to be higher. So the model would be
    forced to used the initial rolls, when available, instead of the next rolls.

    So instead of Minimize ( Sum of y ) or Minimize( Sum([1,1,0]) )
    we Minimize( Sum([1*1, 1*2, 1*3]) )

  Book Author's note from page 201:

  There are alternative objective functions. For example, we could have minimized the sum of the waste. This makes sense, especially if the demand constraint is formulated as an inequality. Then minimizing the sum of waste Chapter 7  advanCed teChniques
  will spend more CPU cycles trying to find more efficient patterns that over-satisfy demand. This is especially good if the demand widths recur regularly and storing cut rolls in inventory to satisfy future demand is possible.
